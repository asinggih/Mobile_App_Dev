# Assignment 2 - Student Management App


## Assignment Details

For this assignment, you are required to create a simple Student Management for iOS devices
using XCode Swift. The app includes a home screen that includes one or more decorative images
and options (e.g. button, menu items, etc.) The App has three main functions aside from the home
screen:

1. Allow user to view and manipulate students
3. Allow user to view and manipulate exams associated to a student
4. Allow user to view and manipulate images that are associated with students

In particular, the App should

#### Pass level ( up to 64%)

- Provide the main interface and corresponding actions where user can select an option from
buttons including “add new student record”, “edit student record” and delete student
records”.

	- Add a new student record: the user can enter a student information, including student Id (unique for each student), first name, last name, gender, course study, age and address.
	
	- Edit a student record: the user can select a student from the list. The program will
display all information of the student in the corresponding fields where the information
can be edited.

	- Delete student records: user can select one or more friends from the list. When the
delete button is pressed, all selected records (checked items) will be removed.

- Be able to return to the home page or the previous page

- Provide a good quality user interface - Are the screens easy to use? Are they laid out neatly?
Do they look good?

#### Credit level ( up to 64%)

Include all functions of the pass level, plus

- Store data in a local SQLLite database, and implement ```INSERT```, ```UPDATE```, ```SELECT``` and
```DELETE``` on the database

- Use more advanced interface item rather just text fields for the form (e.g. switches or
segmented controls should be use for gender, stepper for age and table view for showing the
list of students, etc...
	
#### Distinction level ( up to 84%):

Include all functions of the credit level, plus

- Provide the main interface and implemented actions to view and manipulate exams
associated with a student. When the user selects a student, in addition to the edit and the
delete options, the app also includes an option for the exam manipulation. The exam
manipulation can be shown on the following page, including

	- Add a new exam: the user can add an exam to the list. The exam record includes exam
name, date and time, location.

	- Edit or remove an exam record: the user can select an exam from the list for a
particular student. The program will display full detail information in the
corresponding fields where they can be edited or removed.

	- View all the exam record, including current exams and past exams. Note: the program
should check the current date/time to flag the exams.

	- Have highly readable coding styles with Object Oriented structure and comments.
	
	- Screen displays should be of high quality.
	
#### High Distinction level (up to 98%):
Include all functions of the distinction level, plus 2 of the following features (7% for each)

-  an ability to show a student’s address on the map. (Note: the address is included with the
student’s record, and you may use your MAC laptop to implement this feature);

-  provide an interface and corresponding actions where user can assign an image to a
student. The images can be manually stored within the app itself or in the photo gallery. The
app should be able to display the assigned image when showing the friend’s information.

*Any figures beyond the requirements are welcomed and they might be considered as extra
contributions.*


## Deliverables
You are only allowed to use Android Java to code your solution. Your program must be
executable. It is an advice that you need to keep multiple versions in case of unforeseen
problems. You are allowed to demonstrate your program on your laptop. You might modify the
code from related source(s) with a proper citation(s) and you must be able to explain clearly your
understanding. The external code should contribute less than 30% of the total program. No part
of the code can be written by any other persons.
